      "Scikit-build: A build system generator for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython extensions.\n",
      "We present “Scikit-build”, an improved build system generator for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython extensions. It provides improved support for additional compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating dependencies and determining their build requirements over distutils/setuptools. We also describe how ITK and VTK C++ scientific libraries were updated to make use of scikit-build to ultimately be published as wheels.\n",
      "Although the scientific packages NumPy, SciPy, SymEngine and Matplotlib can be used from Python today, since they bundle C, C++, Fortran or Cython extensions, successfully building the associated binary wheels is complex and prone to errors. This is a significant barrier to allow use of these packages on a broader set of platforms such as mobile, Raspberry Pi or HPC.\n",
      "We present [scikit-build](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-build/), an improved build system generator for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython extensions that provides first-class support for additional compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating dependencies and their associated build requirements. The scikit-build package is fundamentally glue between the setuptools and [cmake](https://pypi.org/project/cmake/) Python packages that is used to facilitate the build process.\n",
      "In this talk, we will provide an overview of scikit-build, explain how it can be used to build simple CPython C, C++, Fortran and Cython extensions, and also describe how the build system of more complex C++ packages like the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) and the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) were updated to support generating wheels for multiple operating systems and python versions.\n",

      "Python has a mature ecosystem for extensions using C/C++, with Cython being part of the standard toolset for scientific programming. Even so,  C/C++ still have many drawbacks, ranging from smaller annoyances (like library packaging, versioning and build systems) to serious one like buffer overflows and undefined behavior leading to security issues. Rust is a system programming language trying to avoid many of the C/C++ pitfalls, on top of providing a good development workflow and memory safety guarantees. This work presents a way to write extensions in Rust and use them in Python, using sourmash [Brown and Irber, 2016] as an example.\n",

But I just started a great job_co_ and have my family and all I really need to be happy - as stuff is only stuff. And I just bought the brand new Microsoft Surface 2 laptop with the NVidea 1060 graphics card with 8 GB ram and 1 TB of Solid State Drive for memory. It cost almost $3500.00_co_ but so well worth it! This machine is a monster! I_t_ve yet to work on a new desktop that can out-perform this beast - and it only weighs 1.7 lbs if you remove the keyboard - and the screen is absolutely beautiful. Even if you can_t_t afford it_co_ buy it - as you_t_ll work that much faster and that much easier that it will easily pay for itself.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tAnyway_co_ please let me know any thoughts all you devs might have.

difficult task due to the source we_t_re working with on so many different levels. And I_t_ve only seen successful applications for the Kinect V2 written using Python_co_ as it_t_s the most compatible wrap around language available which has many of the functions necessary already written into the API. Regardless_co_ we_t_re most likely looking at something quite messy if I rquire anything beyond _qt_simple._qt_\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tAnd you nailed the features I initially need for my current project. I need to track different colored _qt_bean bags_qt_ or small bags with some weight behind them which will be thrown at a projected image on a wall. So the info you_t_ve provided gives me a starting place_co_ and I can use all the help I can get in the coming weeks. So far_co_ it appears d-able_sm_ however_co_ I have little experience with more than 2 Kinect units_co_ and have used primarily the basic functions clearly written and easily accessible through the SDK. So if you have time to assist_co_ I might really need the help. After this_co_ then I_t_d like to try and implement a real-time capture volume using more than one Kinect V2 - however_co_ I do know what this will require_co_ and it_t_s quite a bit above my pay grade. But I_t_ll cross that bridge soon - perhaps real soon - but I absolutely need to track 10 - 12 different colored bean filled bags or spheres in order to get the current project finished - and finished on time which is before March 1st.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\t I_t_ve been looking at all resources online_co_ as there has been a good bit of work done using three.js_co_ but there_t_s not any projects which the developers provide all of the code - which I certainly understand as the wok that_t_s been done is certainly no small task_co_ and definitely worth revenue as many developers using three.js have been asking to use the code. But first_co_ I_t_m looking for info such as the limits for opening and maintaining a Web Socket connection between multiple Kinect V2s -which I_t_ve yet to find out how many Kinects can currently be connected at any given time. The limit used to be 8_co_ however_co_ I_t_m not certain if this limit still exists_co_ or what work has been accomplished since the release of the V2 and other peripherals which might help maintaining the connections over time. So if you know of any resources concerning these and other areas of new development_co_ I_t_d love to share whatever I_t_ve discovered_co_ and possibly embark on a project to make the most use of depth maps for imaging devices such as the Kinect. One advantage I do have is that I_t_m part of a group of many of the best engineers and developers anywhere in the world_co_ as we_t_re writing most of the applications for Sony devices_sm_ and I personally work on the R&amp_sm_D side of Sony where we get to push the envelope as far as we possibly can. Needless to say_co_ I love my job - possibly more than any job in my recent past. But I can make use of many of these resources as needed_co_ which provides me with advantages few others have in any industry - as Sony is definately leading in the areas of smart phones and most all other entertainment devices.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tSo let me know what you might think about all of the above_co_ and I_t_d love to consider what we might be able to pull together in search of new applications few have ever considered designing - yet building.

He just needs someone like me to push him through to the end_co_ as his attention span is extremely low_co_ since he knows he is able to accomplish most everything he sets out to do - and that_t_s a dangerous place in which to allow your mind to live.

But that_t_s where I find the most _qt_fun_qt_ in any aspect of technology_co_ and where I_t_ve been able to accomplish the most. It_t_s places like this where I brought the Matrix to life as well as Gollum - and people often marvel about Avatar - however_co_ most everything we did to accomplish Avatar was already a decade old and developed for films such as the first Mortal Kombat movie among other projects overlooked due to the times or often due to their audience. But it_t_s been exciting for me personally_co_ although it_t_s often reported that we broke technical barriers on Avatar_sm_ whereas the real truth is that we had already developed and used the technologies years before Jim ever conceived of the script - but that_t_s another story.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tAgain_co_ let me know your thoughts as you appear to be interested in looking into this further.

I don_t_t need to know anything except when the bags come in contact with the wall. Prior to this_co_ there is no need to track where_co_ when_co_ or any other attribute of the bags. I definitely have a clear position in pixel depth when the bags hit the wall_co_ and can track this with simple acceleration/deceleration if necessary. However_co_ I_t_m certain that the depth map will provide a position in space independent of any physics which will show when each bag meets the position of the wall as the projector is projecting the image.

written!\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tI have found that I need local rotations to write Blender actions_co_ so I have re-coded some of the BJS Matrix functions into C++.  If this ever gets ported for BJS_co_ then that part is already being done and in it_t_s own thread.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tThe animation is still all screwed up once in blender.  Just hopefully need to divide and conquer_dd_ the Y-Z swap_co_ and establish a baseline location of the root bone with the first frame.  Then subtract the baseline out for all the frames.  Will first do things in python_co_ and move them to the C++ side as they make the picture better.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tSpeaking of first frames_co_ most of my captures so far are me just running into the scene after I hit the record button.  I need a clean first frame.  Not that I cannot delete frames in front in Blender_co_ but the baseline location is not zeroed when I want it to be.  I have come up with an _qt_Action_qt_ pose_co_ where frames get discarded until the finger tips of both hands are wider than the shoulders of the opposite side.  This is done in C++_co_ and I even call MessageBeep() when it is triggered_co_ which is oddly very satisfying.\\n_lt_/p_gt_\\n\\n_lt_p_gt_\\n\\tFor multi-body recordings_co_ I have a UI problem.  I want to do the recording_co_ but not assign Blender actions to the individual skeletons until later.  Bringing up a list in Blender is not that easy to understand_co_ at least.  _lt_a
